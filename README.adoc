WARNING: ALPHA work here.

== Rationale

A library to return public APIs for Clojure/ClojureScript projects. Recognizes that publics APIs can be altered at load
time by tools such as import-vars.

Cljdoc-analyzer's first use is for cljdoc but others might find value in this library.

== History

Some Clojure/ClojureScript projects alter their APIs and related metadata at load time through tools such as
https://github.com/ztellman/potemkin[potemkin import-vars].

https://github.com/weavejester/codox[Codox] was coded to understand these alterations for the Clojure projects it
documents. Historically, cljdoc took advantage of these smarts via a branch on a fork of codox to get the API metadata
it needed to document Clojure/ClojureScript project. This branch also had an unmerged PR that understood
ClojureScript import-vars type metadata manipulation.

Cljdoc-analyzer picks up from the cljdoc codox unmerged PR in the internal metagetta sub-project and adds what was the
cljdoc analysis-runner module under the main src.

See link:doc/design/01-migration-from-analysis-runner.adoc[migration from analisys runner] for more details.

== Tips for library authors

=== AOT Compilation

AOT-compiled namespaces will lose their metadata, which means you'll lose documentation for namespaces. Avoid having
global `:aot` directives in your project; instead, place them in a specialized profile, such as `:uberjar`.


=== Metadata Examples

Cljdoc analyzer will recognize the following special metadata.

==== :no-doc
The `:no-doc` metadata key is a convention invented by codox to indicate that an element should not be included in api documentation.

Examples:

[source,clojure]
----
;; Documented
(defn square
"Squares the supplied number."
[x]
(* x x))

;; Not documented
(defn ^:no-doc hidden-square
"Squares the supplied number."
[x]
(* x x))
----

`:no-doc` can also be used at the namespace level:

For example:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns ^:no-doc hidden-ns)
----

For autodoc legacy reasons, codox considers `:skip-wiki` to be equivalent to `:no-doc` and cljdoc-analyzer does the same.

==== :added

To denote the library version the var was added in, use the `:added` metadata key:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn square
"Squares the supplied number."
{:added "1.0"}
[x]
(* x x))
----

==== :deprecated

Similar to `:added`, deprecated vars can be denoted with the `:deprecated` metadata key:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn square
"Squares the supplied number."
{:deprecated "2.0"}
[x]
(* x x))
----


== Warning

Cljdoc-analyzer is not a static code analyzer.  It is interested in the result of programmatic load time alterations.
Use the same judgement you would when using any 3rd party library. If you don't trust it, don't cljdoc-analyze it.

== Usage

=== cljdoc use

Cljdoc-analyzer's first customer is cljdoc. This usage does not cater to general usability. Cljdoc started with
conventional command line arguments but then switched to edn because it made more sense for its use case.

Example of analyzing cljfmt v0.6.4:
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
clojure -m cljdoc-analyzer.cljdoc-main \
  '{:project "cljfmt/cljfmt"
    :version "0.6.4"
    :jarpath "http://repo.clojars.org/cljfmt/cljfmt/0.6.4/cljfmt-0.6.4.jar"
    :pompath "http://repo.clojars.org/cljfmt/cljfmt/0.6.4/cljfmt-0.6.4.pom"
    :extra-repos {"clojars" {:url "https://repo.clojars.org/"}
                  "central" {:url "http://central.maven.org/maven2/"}}}'
----

The `:extra-repos` options is somewhat contrived as these repos already exist in cljdoc-analyzer's default config, but this does
reflect current cljdoc usage.

This will log to stdout and, if successful, write to a file in a predefined known spot, as indicated in the output logs:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
2019-08-26 14:22:28,061 INFO  cljdoc-analyzer.runner - results file: /tmp/cljdoc/analysis-out/cljdoc-edn/cljfmt/cljfmt/0.6.4/cljdoc.edn
----

=== general use
You can use cljdoc-analyzer ad hoc to get data for a project published to a maven repo. For example:

[source,bash,no-wrap]
----
clojure -m cljdoc-analyzer.main analyze \
  --project io.aviso/pretty --version "0.1.29" \
  --output-filename "io-aviso-pretty-0.1.29.edn"
----
On successful completion, you'll find the output in the current directory in `io.aviso-pretty-0.1.29.edn`

When you are working on a local project, publish it to your local maven repo first, then run the cljdoc analyze command.

If you only want to suppress items that have been marked to be excluded from documentation, use `--exclude-with`.
To match what cljdoc uses, you would exclude namespaces and publics tagged with `:no-doc` and/or `:skip-wiki`, and also use the `--extra-repo` option:

[source,bash,no-wrap]
----
clojure -m cljdoc-analyzer.main analyze \
  --project io.aviso/pretty --version "0.1.29" \
  --output-filename "io-aviso-pretty-0.1.29.edn" \
  --exclude-with :no-doc \
  --exclude-with :skip-wiki \
  --extra-repo "clojars https://repo.clojars.org/" \
  --extra-repo "central http://central.maven.org/maven2/"
----

We can look at other features as we get a feel for what folks are interested in.

=== logging

If using cljdoc-analyzer as a library, provide your own logging config as appropriate for your app.
A sample `logback.xml` config that logs to stdout can be found under `resources`.

== Output format

The output is a map of namespaces and their publics.

=== edn encoding

The edn has a twist. Function arglists can sometimes contain regular expressions
as desconstructed default values. Since edn does not support deserializing
serialized regular expressions, we adapt by serializing regexes as `#regex`
followed by the string version of regex. For example:
----
#".*booya.*"
----
is serialized as:
----
#regex ".*booya.*"
----
See `cljdoc-analyzer.analysis-edn/serialize-cljdoc-edn` and `cljdoc-analyzer.analysis-edn/deserialize-cljdoc-edn`.

=== map

The edn output is a map of:

* `:group-id` project group-id
* `:artifact-id` project artifact-id
* `:version` project version
* `:analysis` analysis for languages which can consist of a map with none, one or both of:
** `clj` list of namespaces (see below)
** `cljs` list of namespaces (see below)
* `:pom-str` slurp of maven pom file

list of namespaces is a list of maps of:

** `:name` namespace name
** `:doc` namespace doc string
** `:author` namespace author
** `:publics` namespace publics which is a list of maps of:
*** `:name` public element name
*** `:type` one of: `:macro` `:multimethod` `:protocol` `:var`
*** `:doc`  doc string
*** `:file` file relative to jar root
*** `:line` line number
*** `:arglists` list of vectors of arglists, omitted for `def` `record` and `protocol` elements
*** `:members`  only applicable when `:type` is `:protocol`, list of maps of:
**** `:arglists`  list of vectors of arglists
**** `:name` name of protocol method
**** `:type` can this be only `:var`?

special metadata tags when present are included in publics:

* `:dynamic` for dynamic defs

special metadata tags when present are included on namespaces  publics:

* `:added` version an element was added
* `:deprecated` version an element was deprecated
* `:no-doc` author requests that this item be excluded from docs
* `:skip-wiki` legacy synonym for `:no-doc`, please use `:no-doc`.

== Internal Workings

We use `clojure.tools.namespace` and `cljs.analyzer.api` to load source and collect metadata. This requires the loading
of a project's dependencies. To avoid dependency conflicts and confusion, we keep dependencies at a minimum during
metadata collection time by splitting the work into two distinct phases.

. Prepare for analysis - the source for this work can be found under link:src[src]. Here we do everything we can to prepare for
  metadata collection.
. Collect metadata - the source for this work can be found under link:metagetta[metagetta]. A separate metagetta process
  is launched to collect metadata on sources prepared in step 1.


== Testing

We make use of https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha] for testing.

Metagetta is a separate sub-project with its own unit tests. To run metagetta unit tests:
----
cd metagetta
clojure -A:test
----

Cljdoc-analyzer has integration and unit tests, to run them all, ensure you are in cljdoc-analyzer root dir and:
----
clojure -A:test
----

The integration tests can take a while to run, to run unit tests only:
----
clojure -A:test unit
----

To run integration tests only:
----
clojure -A:test integration
----

To automatically rerun tests on any changes, tack on a `--watch` to any of the above commands. See kaocha docs for other options.

== Linting

We make use of https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo[clj-kondo] for linting.

Our build server validates the code is lint free with `script/lint.sh` and so can you.

* following are resolved for me, but good idea to review with project owner (Martin)
** Ignore repos configured by cljdoc, rely on repos configured in analysis runner only
   These are the base maven repos to use and is currently:

   :maven-repositories [{:id "clojars" :url "https://repo.clojars.org/"}
                        {:id "central" :url "http://central.maven.org/maven2/"}]

   But deps.clj has default repos:

   (def ^:private default-repos
     {"central" {:url "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/"},
      "clojars" {:url "https://repo.clojars.org/"}
      ;; Included to account for https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/TDEPS-46
      ;; specifically anything depending on org.immutant/messaging will fail
      ;; this includes compojure-api
      "jboss" {:url "https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/"}
      ;; included for https://github.com/FundingCircle/jackdaw
      "confluent" {:url "https://packages.confluent.io/maven/"}})

   Which repeats "clojars" and overrides "central".

   So it looks to  me, like I can ignore repos. I think it can safely be removed from cljdoc config.
